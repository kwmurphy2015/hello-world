Creating my first repository and learning about Github
A bit about myself. I've done pretty basic computer support for  years - IT Fundamentals, A+, Net+, Sec+ certified - and have struggled working low-end support jobs. And now I'm older, 60+, and still need to work for a living. In learning about Github, I hope to learn what I can to make myself useful and maybe even make enough greenbacks to retire. If not, well, I'm still learning, for what it's worth. Oh, these are my changes
